# Rational Number in C++

## Motivation

This library is for representing rational number precisely, in decimal or other positional system, such as binary form.

## Quick Start

This library is released as single C++ header: `rational.h`

There are examples in `demo.cpp`, it can be built and run as:

```sh
$ make
$ ./demo.out
```

It will prompt:

```
0      = 0
1      = 1
2 / 1  = 2
1 / 2  = 0.5
5 / 2  = 2.5
2 / 5  = 0.4
1 / 3  = 0.(3)...
3 / 7  = 0.(428571)...
22 / 7 = 3.(142857)...
1 / 10 = 0.1
1 / 10 = (binary) 0.0(0011)...
```
